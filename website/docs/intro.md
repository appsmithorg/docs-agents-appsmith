# Introducing Appsmith Agents

**Appsmith Agents** is the easiest way to build custom AI agents that work exactly where you work — inside your internal tools, workflows, and applications.

With Appsmith Agents, you can quickly create AI-powered experiences that are deeply integrated with your business data, workflows, and user interfaces. Whether you're enhancing an existing application or building something entirely new, Agents help you go from idea to impact — fast.

## What Are Appsmith Agents?

Appsmith Agents are intelligent, customizable AI assistants that can:

- **Access your organization’s data**: Connect securely to databases, APIs, and other data sources using Appsmith’s existing integrations.
- **Embed directly inside your apps**: Drop agents into your current Appsmith applications to extend their capabilities with natural language interfaces and intelligent behavior.
- **Trigger complex workflows**: Combine agents with UI widgets and custom JavaScript to orchestrate multi-step processes across tools and teams.
- **Enable human-in-the-loop automation**: Build AI workflows where agents and humans collaborate — with configurable checkpoints, reviews, and approvals.

Whether you're automating support tasks, streamlining onboarding, helping users navigate internal tools, or building full-fledged AI copilots for your team, Appsmith Agents give you the building blocks to do it — all within the platform you already use and love.
