Appsmith Agents is a platform to scale your support, sales, success, and people teams with secure, embedded agents powered by your data.
With Appsmith Agents, you can quickly create AI-powered experiences that are deeply integrated with your business data, workflows, and user interfaces. Whether you're enhancing an existing process or building something entirely new, Agents help you go from idea to impact — fast.

## What Are Agents?

Agents are secure, AI-powered assistants that live inside the tools your teams already use — like CRMs, dashboards, help desks, and HR platforms.
They help your support, sales, success, and people teams:

* Instantly answer questions using real-time data
* Automate repetitive or multi-step processes
* Highlight insights and next steps inside everyday tools
* Involve the right people when human input is needed

Agents use natural language and your existing business logic to speed up tasks, reduce manual effort, and improve decision-making.

## Why Use Appsmith Agents?

* **1-click RAG:** Give context from your unstructured data without having to build complex pipelines. Instantly boost your agents with relevant knowledge from docs, chats, tickets, and more.
* **Embed privately anywhere:** Add agents directly into the tools your teams use — from internal dashboards to help desks — with full control over access and visibility.
* **Seamless integrations:** Connect to your existing data stack using Appsmith's native connectors — databases, APIs, SaaS tools, and more — with zero friction.
* **Powerful customization:** Use drag-and-drop UI widgets, JavaScript logic, and workflows to build intelligent agents tailored to your team’s exact needs and processes.
* **Enterprise-grade security:** Agents come with built-in access control, audit logs, and enterprise-level security to meet your compliance and governance needs.
